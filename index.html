          <h1 class="title">Company History</h1>
          <p>JavaScripts was founded in 2016 in Nashville, Tennessee. Today it is one of the world&rsquo;s leading e-commerce platforms for on-demand printing of clothing and accessories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sellers offer their merchandise or personalised products, showing their designs on JavaScripts&rsquo; Marketplace or thousands of independent shops. Customers can also use the T-Shirt Designer to create clothing and accessories with their own designs or designs from our community.
          </p>
          <h2 class="title">The Production Process</h2>
          <p>
            The way from uploading a graphics file to a unique personalised item is one involving a lot of manual craftsmanship and passion for detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some 300 co-workers at four production sites in Europe and the USA make sure that our T-shirts, bags and accessories are embellished to each customer&rsquo;s liking. The products are inspected and routine-tested before being dispatched to all corners of the world. And if there is ever reason for complaint, our friendly customer service will support any queries in 6 languages.
          </p>
          <h2 class="title">Responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            We at JavaScripts have a great responsibility to our customers and our staff. It is important for us to be aware of actions and their consequences at our headquarters in Nashville and anywhere else in the world that we communicate to our audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our decisions are always transparent and open to scrutiny: Employees, customers and anyone interested in our conduct are invited to take part. Please refer any issues related to responsibility@javascripts.net.
